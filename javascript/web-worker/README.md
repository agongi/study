A worker is an object created using a constructor (e.g. [`Worker()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker/Worker)) that runs a named JavaScript file — this file contains the code that will run in the worker thread; workers run in another global context that is different from the current [`window`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window)
